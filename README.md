# PLUGIN SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION (Made by Bladeee)

This document describes the structure and usage of the `game_tick_packet`, which contains the real-time game state in Rocket League. The packet includes information about the ball's position, player stats, team information, game status, and more. It also describes how to format a plugin, and create a plugin. It is fundamentally the RLBOT API.

self.BotController("enable", botname="nexto", source="plugin_name")
self.BotController("enable", botname="carbon", source="plugin_name") 
self.BotController("enable", botname="arkangel", source="plugin_name")

# Disable current bot
self.BotController("disable", source="plugin_name")
```

---

## Example Usage

```python
# -- Some Example Usages of the API.

# self.player_index would be our up to date index supplied by the API, however you can choose any.
# Accessing the player's car location (X, Y, Z)
car_location_x = game_tick_packet.game_cars[player_index].physics.location.x
car_location_y = game_tick_packet.game_cars[player_index].physics.location.y
car_location_z = game_tick_packet.game_cars[player_index].physics.location.z

self.ConsoleLogger(f"Player's car location: ({car_location_x}, {car_location_y}, {car_location_z})")


# Assuming player_index is the index of the player whose team you want to check
player_index = 0  # self.player_index would be our local player index. 

# Get the team of the player by looking up their team index in game_cars
player_team_index = game_tick_packet.game_cars[player_index].team

# Get team info (team score, etc.)
team_info = game_tick_packet.teams[player_team_index]
self.ConsoleLogger(f"Player's team index: {player_team_index}")
self.ConsoleLogger(f"Team score: {team_info.score}")


# Accessing the game tick packet to print ball location
self.ConsoleLogger(f"Ball location: X = {game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.x}, "
                  f"Y = {game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.y}, "
                  f"Z = {game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.z}")

# Checking if the game has ended
if game_tick_packet.game_info.is_match_ended:
    self.ConsoleLogger("The match has ended.")

# Accessing the first player's information (car)
first_player = game_tick_packet.game_cars[0]
self.ConsoleLogger(f"First player name: {first_player.name}")
self.ConsoleLogger(f"Boost amount: {first_player.boost}")
self.ConsoleLogger(f"Car position: {first_player.physics.location.x}, {first_player.physics.location.y}, {first_player.physics.location.z}")
```
---

## Example of Using Location Data
You might want to determine if your car is close to the ball or check its position relative to the goal. Here's an example:

```python
# Assuming you have the ball's position as well:
ball_location_x = game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.x
ball_location_y = game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.y
ball_location_z = game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.z

# Calculate the distance between the player's car and the ball
distance_to_ball = ((car_location_x - ball_location_x) ** 2 + 
                    (car_location_y - ball_location_y) ** 2 + 
                    (car_location_z - ball_location_z) ** 2) ** 0.5

self.ConsoleLogger(f"Distance to the ball: {distance_to_ball} units")
```

## Controlling the Bot and Plugin Info
Here is the documentation for the format of the plugin system, how it works, and some basic examples.

The plugin API provides a recent game tick packet every tick, along with an up-to-date local_player_index and player name. The `main()` function of your plugin will be called constantly, which is why a `time.sleep()` is often added to reduce CPU usage or to handle tasks that don't require real-time precision, such as checking only every few seconds.

When creating your own plugin, you must name the class with "plugin_" as the prefix.
Here's an example of printing the ball's location, along with the required name setup and format:

```python
import time
from rlbot.agents.base_agent import SimpleControllerState

class plugin_Get_Ball_xyz:
    def __init__(self, player_index=0, ConsoleLogger=None, BotController=None):
        self.controller = None
        self.player_index = player_index
        self.game_tick_packet = None  # Initialize game_tick_packet to None
        self.ConsoleLogger = ConsoleLogger # Initialize ConsoleLogger variable to print to the gui console
        self.BotController = BotController

    def Name(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Ball location print")
    
    def Description(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Constantly prints the ball location!")
    
    def Author(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Created by User782")
    
    def Version(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("V1.1")

    def game_tick_packet_set(self, packet, local_player_index=0, playername="default", process_id=None):
        self.game_tick_packet = packet
        self.player_index = local_player_index
        self.pid = process_id
        self.playername = playername

        if self.controller:
            return self.controller
        else:
            return None
        
    def main(self):
        target_fps = 120  
        frame_duration = 1.0 / target_fps 
        while True:
            try:
                start_time = time.time()
                if self.game_tick_packet:
                    time.sleep(2)
                    ball_x_y_z = f"Ball Location = X {self.game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.x} y = {self.game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.y} z = {self.game_tick_packet.game_ball.physics.location.z}"
                    self.ConsoleLogger(ball_x_y_z)
                # Enforce the frame rate timing to sync the game ticks
                elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
                sleep_duration = frame_duration - elapsed_time
                if sleep_duration > 0:
                    time.sleep(sleep_duration)

            except Exception as e:
                self.ConsoleLogger(f"Error {e}")
                time.sleep(5)
                self.controller = None
                pass
```

## Controlling the Bot

You can control your bot's movements using the SimpleControllerState. This allows you to set actions such as moving forward, steering, jumping, and boosting.

The `main()` function of your plugin will be called constantly, however your `game_tick_packet_set` function will be called every tick. This ensures that up-to-date game data and information are provided on every tick.

When creating a plugin and needing to return your own custom controller state, the SimpleControllerState is used.

```python
import time
from rlbot.agents.base_agent import SimpleControllerState

class plugin_Get_Ball_xyz:
    def __init__(self, player_index=0, ConsoleLogger=None, BotController=None):
        self.controller = None
        self.player_index = player_index
        self.game_tick_packet = None  # Initialize game_tick_packet to None
        self.ConsoleLogger = ConsoleLogger # Initialize ConsoleLogger variable to print to the gui console
        self.BotController = BotController

    def Name(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Ball location print")
    
    def Description(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Constantly prints the ball location!")
    
    def Author(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Created by User782")
    
    def Version(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("V1.1")

    def game_tick_packet_set(self, packet, local_player_index=0, playername="default", process_id=None):
        self.game_tick_packet = packet
        self.player_index = local_player_index
        self.pid = process_id
        self.playername = playername

        if self.controller:
            return self.controller
        else:
            return None
```

This allows us to return a controller state of our own which will override the bot's controls. Meaning our controller state will be written into memory instead of the bot's.
Returning None will tell our bot to continue running instead of writing our custom controller state.

---
## Using SimpleControllerState

The SimpleControllerState class provides a friendly interface for controlling the bot. This class wraps around the input controls that are sent to the bot for each game tick. It allows you to easily set the bot's behavior (such as jumping, boosting, etc)

Attributes:

    steer: Controls the steering of the car.
        Range: -1 (left) to 1 (right)

    throttle: Controls the car's throttle (acceleration).
        Range: -1 (backward) to 1 (forward)

    pitch: Controls the pitch (nose-up or nose-down).
        Range: -1 (nose-down) to 1 (nose-up)

    yaw: Controls the yaw (nose-left or nose-right).
        Range: -1 (nose-left) to 1 (nose-right)

    roll: Controls the roll (clockwise or anticlockwise rotation).
        Range: -1 (anticlockwise) to 1 (clockwise)

    jump: Controls whether the bot is jumping (True/False).

    boost: Controls whether the bot is boosting (True/False).

    handbrake: Controls whether the bot is using the handbrake (True/False).

    use_item: Controls whether the bot is using an item (for rumble mode, True/False).
    
Example:
```python
from rlbot.agents.base_agent import SimpleControllerState

# Create a SimpleControllerState instance
controller = SimpleControllerState(
    steer=0.5,      # Steer right
    throttle=1.0,   # Full throttle (accelerating forward)
    jump=True,      # Jumping
    boost=False,    # Not boosting
    handbrake=False # Not using the handbrake
)
self.controller = controller
```

In the example above:

Steer is set to 0.5, meaning the car will steer to the right at half intensity.
Throttle is set to 1.0, meaning the car is accelerating forward at full speed.
Jump is set to True, meaning the bot will jump on this tick.
Boost and Handbrake are set to False, so the bot will not boost or use the handbrake.

Then in `game_tick_packet_set`, because we have set `self.controller`, it will write it into memory instead of the current bot running output. So make sure to set `self.controller` back to None in order for the bot to then continue running after you have finished writing whatever movements you needed. You can do this by simple checks.

---

## Combining everything together. (Creating a basic plugin)
This plugin demonstrates how to create a simple bot plugin that jumps only when its wheels are on the ground. The bot uses the `SimpleControllerState` to control its jumping behavior.

Returning a `controller_state` will override the bot's controls in favor of ours. Return `None` to allow the bot to continue running as normal.
```python
import time
from rlbot.agents.base_agent import SimpleControllerState

class plugin_Jumping:
    def __init__(self, player_index=0, ConsoleLogger=None):
        self.controller = None
        self.player_index = player_index
        self.game_tick_packet = None  # Initialize game_tick_packet to None
        self.ConsoleLogger = ConsoleLogger # Initialize ConsoleLogger variable to print to the gui console

    def Name(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Plugin Jumping")

    def Description(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Jumps whenever the car's wheels are on the ground!")
    
    def Author(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("Created by skiffy")

    def Version(self):
        self.ConsoleLogger("V1.0")

    def game_tick_packet_set(self, packet, local_player_index=0, playername="default", process_id=None):
        self.game_tick_packet = packet
        self.player_index = local_player_index
        self.pid = process_id
        self.playername = playername
        # Here we override the controls with our custom state, or return None to let the bot play.
        if self.controller: 
            return self.controller
        else:
            return None

    def main(self):
        while True:
            try:
                if self.game_tick_packet:
                    controller = SimpleControllerState()
                    
                    # Get the current local player's car (ours)
                    player_car = self.game_tick_packet.game_cars[self.player_index]
                    
                    # Jump if wheels are in contact with the ground
                    if player_car.has_wheel_contact:
                        controller.jump = True
                        self.controller = controller # When conditions are met, we override the bot's controls with ours! 
                    else:
                        self.controller = None # Let's the bot continue to write to memory instead of our custom controller state

                # Small sleep to prevent high CPU usage
                time.sleep(1 / 120)

            except Exception as e:
                self.ConsoleLogger(f"Error: {e}")
                time.sleep(5)
                self.controller = None
```
